# The Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey

## What is RHoMIS

RHoMIS was designed to improve the process of gathering information 
from farming households in the rural developing world. Household 
surveys are very widely carried out, but the data is rarely comparable, 
and so the opportunities for learning between individual projects are limited. 
For these reasons, the tool balances standardisation with flexibility.
 
RHoMIS was also designed to reduce costs, time requirements, and reporting 
burdens for those who carry out household surveys. Internationally recognised 
indicators are used, and reflexive learning since 2015 has led to a smooth and 
rapid questionnaire, which gathers considerable detail in a relatively short amount of time.
 

## What is in this Repository

We have been working hard on making RHoMIS easier to use. We have built tools that:

* Build surveys
* Manage data
* Calculate key indicators

You can find the source code for all of these tools in this repository!
